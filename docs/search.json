Convert inf values to NaN before operating instead.\n  with pd.option_context('mode.use_inf_as_na', True):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows penguins as points colored by sex, with species as the x-axis and body mass (in grams) on the y-axis. This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins. Therefore gender might be a useful tool in predicting penguin species.\n\nsns.catplot(data=train, kind=\"violin\", x=\"Delta 13 C (o/oo)\", y=\"Island\", hue=\"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the penguins of different species with different colors graphed on Delta 13 C (o/oo) and Island location. Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by themselves.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts. Male Gentoo penguins have longer Culmens then male Chinstraps who have longer Culmens than male Adelie penguins while the order for female penguins descends for Chinstrap, Gentoo, then Adelie. These distinctions could serve useful in training our model to differentiate species. It also serves to note that the gender distinction matters when comparing species.\n\n\n\nI then attempted to find three features of the data (one qualitative and two quantitative) and train a model on these features that achieves 100% testing accuracy.\nFirst I did data preparation to prepare the quantitative columns of the data\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle.fit(train[\"Species\"])\n\ndef prepare_data(df):\n  df = df.drop([\"studyName\", \"Sample Number\", \"Individual ID\", \"Date Egg\", \"Comments\", \"Region\"], axis = 1)\n  df = df[df[\"Sex\"] != \".\"]\n  df = df.dropna()\n  y = le.transform(df[\"Species\"])\n  df = df.drop([\"Species\"], axis = 1)\n  df = pd.get_dummies(df)\n  return df, y\n\nX_train, y_train = prepare_data(train)\n\n\nX_train.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nIsland_Biscoe\nIsland_Dream\nIsland_Torgersen\nStage_Adult, 1 Egg Stage\nClutch Completion_No\nClutch Completion_Yes\nSex_FEMALE\nSex_MALE\n\n\n\n\n0\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n1\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n4\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI completed an exhaustive iterative search to find the best markers. I used cross validation one each combination of one qualitative and two quantitative column with different models keeping track of the best score for each model. In terms of models I used a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC, and Random Forrest Classifier. For the Decision Tree Classifier and the Random Forrest Classifier I used grid search across the amount of parameters to identify the optimal maximum depth. For SVC I used grid search to find the optimal value for gamma across a wide array of numbers. With the best markers of each model, I also saved the columns of the best score.\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import

This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins.

Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by themselves.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts.

This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins. Therefore gender might be a useful tool in predicting penguin species.\n\nsns.catplot(data=train, kind=\"violin\", x=\"Delta 13 C (o/oo)\", y=\"Island\", hue=\"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the penguins of different species with different colors graphed on Delta 13 C (o/oo) and Island location. Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by itself.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts. Male Gentoo penguins have longer Culmens then male Chinstraps who have longer Culmens than male Adelie penguins while the order for female penguins descends for Chinstrap, Gentoo, then Adelie. These distinctions could serve useful in training our model to differentiate species. It also serves to note that the gender distinction matters when comparing species."
