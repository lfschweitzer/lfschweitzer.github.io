Convert inf values to NaN before operating instead.\n  with pd.option_context('mode.use_inf_as_na', True):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows penguins as points colored by sex, with species as the x-axis and body mass (in grams) on the y-axis. This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins. Therefore gender might be a useful tool in predicting penguin species.\n\nsns.catplot(data=train, kind=\"violin\", x=\"Delta 13 C (o/oo)\", y=\"Island\", hue=\"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the penguins of different species with different colors graphed on Delta 13 C (o/oo) and Island location. Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by themselves.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts. Male Gentoo penguins have longer Culmens then male Chinstraps who have longer Culmens than male Adelie penguins while the order for female penguins descends for Chinstrap, Gentoo, then Adelie. These distinctions could serve useful in training our model to differentiate species. It also serves to note that the gender distinction matters when comparing species.\n\n\n\nI then attempted to find three features of the data (one qualitative and two quantitative) and train a model on these features that achieves 100% testing accuracy.\nFirst I did data preparation to prepare the quantitative columns of the data\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle.fit(train[\"Species\"])\n\ndef prepare_data(df):\n  df = df.drop([\"studyName\", \"Sample Number\", \"Individual ID\", \"Date Egg\", \"Comments\", \"Region\"], axis = 1)\n  df = df[df[\"Sex\"] != \".\"]\n  df = df.dropna()\n  y = le.transform(df[\"Species\"])\n  df = df.drop([\"Species\"], axis = 1)\n  df = pd.get_dummies(df)\n  return df, y\n\nX_train, y_train = prepare_data(train)\n\n\nX_train.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nIsland_Biscoe\nIsland_Dream\nIsland_Torgersen\nStage_Adult, 1 Egg Stage\nClutch Completion_No\nClutch Completion_Yes\nSex_FEMALE\nSex_MALE\n\n\n\n\n0\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n1\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n4\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI completed an exhaustive iterative search to find the best markers. I used cross validation one each combination of one qualitative and two quantitative column with different models keeping track of the best score for each model. In terms of models I used a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC, and Random Forrest Classifier. For the Decision Tree Classifier and the Random Forrest Classifier I used grid search across the amount of parameters to identify the optimal maximum depth. For SVC I used grid search to find the optimal value for gamma across a wide array of numbers. With the best markers of each model, I also saved the columns of the best score.\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import

This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins.

Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by themselves.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts.

This plot displays that on average, male penguins are larger than female penguins. It also shows a trend of Gentoo species of penguins larger than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins- who are relatively similar in size. This indicates that Body Mass (g) could potentially be a useful indicator in indicating species type. It is also important to note that the separation of gender allows us to make these assertions. Gento male penguins are generally larger than Adelie male penguins and the same follows with female penguins of these same two species. However, Gentoo female penguins are roughly the same size as Adelie male penguins. Therefore gender might be a useful tool in predicting penguin species.\n\nsns.catplot(data=train, kind=\"violin\", x=\"Delta 13 C (o/oo)\", y=\"Island\", hue=\"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the penguins of different species with different colors graphed on Delta 13 C (o/oo) and Island location. Delta 13(o/oo) is an interesting indicator as it is widely used as an indicator of diet especially in reference to vegetation. This therefore shows that there could be a large difference in diet between Chinstrap and the other two species of penguins. Adelie penguins are present in all three islands whereas Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins are isolated to one of the three. Therefore Island could be a helpful indicator of species type, but probably would not be indicative by itself.\n\ntable = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).aggregate({'Culmen Length (mm)' : ['min', 'max','mean']})\nprint(table)\n\n                 Culmen Length (mm)                 \n                                min   max       mean\nSpecies   Sex                                       \nAdelie    FEMALE               34.0  42.2  37.426415\n          MALE                 34.6  46.0  40.404918\nChinstrap FEMALE               40.9  58.0  46.722581\n          MALE                 49.0  55.8  51.334615\nGentoo    .                    44.5  44.5  44.500000\n          FEMALE               40.9  50.5  45.455102\n          MALE                 44.4  55.9  49.006818\n\n\nThis table indicates that on average male penguins have longer Culmen Length than their female counterparts. Male Gentoo penguins have longer Culmens then male Chinstraps who have longer Culmens than male Adelie penguins while the order for female penguins descends for Chinstrap, Gentoo, then Adelie. These distinctions could serve useful in training our model to differentiate species. It also serves to note that the gender distinction matters when comparing species."

If there are one or two of these categories on which you’d especially like to focus, list them below. Feel free to include any details that you’d like – this can help me tailor the course content to your interests.\nWhile I would like to develop skills in all four main areas of our course, I would like to focus specifically on experimentation and social responsibility this semester. I believe that focusing on growth in experimentation and social responsibility will give me the ability to critically analyze important topics of machine learning. By the end of this course, I want to be able to critically analyze machine learning models by understanding how to assess performance and question the source/harms of biases present. I choose to take this class partially because of the overwhelming prevalence of ML models in our daily lives and the popular belief that every CS major/SWE has a unique and especially educated perspective on the impact of AI on the world overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost blog posts will require around 5-8 hours on average to complete, plus time for revisions in response to feedback. Blog posts will most frequently involve a mix of mathematical problem-solving, coding, experimentation, and written discussion. Some blog posts will ask you to critically discuss recent readings in an essay-like format.\nAchieving an A in the course signifies that “I am ready to take the theory, techniques, and ideas of this course into my future classes, projects, hobbies, or career.” I would like to move forward in achieving that goal through my blog posts in this course. Therefore, I would like to complete blog posts in all important areas of focus in the class material and work to respond to feedback for the majority of my posts as I see revision as the most valuable way to learn. I hope to continue learning outside the class by complete areas of my blog posts that are either not covered in class or that I feel especially unclear about.

We’ll spend the first 10-15 minutes of most class periods on warmup activities. You’re expected to have prepared the warmup activity ahead of time (this means you’ll need to have completed the readings as well). Each time, we’ll sort into groups of 5-6 students, and one of you (randomly selected) will be responsible for presenting the activity on the whiteboard. If you’re not feeling prepared to present the activity, you can “pass” to the next person, or ask for help along the way.\nI plan to participate in the course actively everyday. I will show up to every warmup prepared and share my ideas and questions. I hope to earn a “Pass” at least once while presenting for the group for warmup and answer at least one question posed to the class every week. In addition, I hope to ask a question in class or at office hours almost every week. I believe interrogating the material by asking questions is the most important method to truly understanding the material.\n\n\n\nTo finish off the course, you’ll complete a long-term project that showcases your interests and skills. You’ll be free to propose and pursue a topic. My expectation is that most projects will move significantly beyond the content covered in class in some way: you might implement a new algorithm, study a complex data set in depth, or conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm. You’ll be expected to complete this project in small groups (of your choosing), and update us at a few milestones along the way.\nPlease share a bit about what kind of topic might excite you, and set a few goals about how you plan to show up as a constructive team-member and co-inquirer (see the ideas for some inspiration).\nI am excited by the idea of conducting a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm, specifically an algorithm with broad real life application. I would like this project to help me improve my ability to analyze machine learning models critically and become a socially responsible engineer.
